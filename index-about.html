                    <p class="text-gray-600">Hello! I'm Stephanie Zolton, a passionate graphic designer based in Cleveland, Ohio. With a keen eye for detail and a love for creativity, I specialize in crafting visual stories that captivate and inspire, along with a detailed history in print production, apparel design and illustration, and brand identity. My journey in design began over six years ago, and since then, I've had the privilege of working with a diverse range of clients and projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From branding and marketing materials to web design and illustration, I thrive on bringing ideas to life in innovative and meaningful ways. I believe that great design is more than just aesthetics; it's about communication and connection. Each project is an opportunity to tell a story, evoke emotion, and make a lasting impression.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Outside of design, I enjoy rock concerts, spin classes, watching the Cavs, and walks on the beach, which often inspire my work and keep me creatively energized. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to collaborate. Whether you're looking to refresh your brand, create stunning visuals, or bring your ideas to life, I'm here to help.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Let's create something amazing together!</p>
